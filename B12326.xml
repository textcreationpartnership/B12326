Although on [par.]3 recto of the original issue Typing says: "If any man would know the patron of this discourse, let him understand that it belongs to Everybody", it is doubtful if he imagined anyone would take him quite so literally.  Furthermore, the name of Darcie's dedicatee on pi3 recto, William, Lord Maynard, is evidently overprinted or hand-stamped and darkened by pen; should a 2nd copy turn up, one would expect to find a different dedicatee--STC.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The reason why I doe it is more pleasant and fairer then Curious, forasmuch as the Queene of the <hi>Amazones</hi> and the Divine <hi>Plato</hi> have wandred far behold meerely the shadow of <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Vnder the name of <hi>Alexander</hi> and of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> Can I not be touched with this Laudable desire to shew the World that I admire it really in you both in Soule and Body, for all do know that you are such a Lord as <hi>Alexander</hi> would have beene for a Monarch, I meane conquerour of a new World, Since that you conquer the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this, but onely for the love of the other, and that you are not onely one of the wise of <hi>Greece,</hi> but one of the wisest of this World, as having beene honourably educated in true Honours Schoole, whence it comes that you so abound in <hi>Noblenesse</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> Your greatnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so perfect, that after you have vanquisht your enemies, for your last <hi>Victory,</hi> you tryumph over your selfe.

For they leaue vs, when we leaue the world, and they nothing availe vs in the day of triall, when our bodies shall descend into the slimie vally, &amp; our soules returne to God that gaue them, then all the

Me thinkes the serious consideration hereof, should even cut the heart, and damp the mirth, and wound the very soule of the most glorious and selfe pleasing worldling, whose life is nothing but a change of recreations, to thinke vpon his fading state, his flowing condition, his declining ioy, his dying life, and endlesse eternitie, to see how all things in him, and about him goe speedily forward in a most sensible declination, to behold with his eies, how his goods, and his greatnesse, his liuings, and his life, and all the most pretious delights which his sensuall heart enioyes, are already winged as it

And then what shall bee his stay, where shall be his shelter, what will remaine to bee done, but with that sad and disconsolate Heathen, to shut vp all in that hopelesse and helplesse lamentation, <hi>Anxius vixi, dubius norior, heu quo vado,</hi> I haue squandred out my life in an vnfruitfull way, I haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved vnresoluedly, and die doubtfully, and now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther away O my soule, woe is thee and alas for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.

               <p>ETernitie is an infinite, endlesse, bottomelesse gulfe, which no line can faddome, no time can reach, no age can extend to, no tongue can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse. It is a duration alwaies present, a being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in being, it is one perpetuall day, which shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see an Euening. Infinite are the descriptions of the Ancients, and divers their expressions, touching this Eternitie. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> conceiuing that God was eternall, and his duration and being to bee properly tearmed Eternitie, represented the diuine power by a Circle, which had neither beginning nor end. And hence it was that the Ancient Romans erected Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which they dedicated to their Gods in a circular figure. Thus <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> deuoted a round Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Maiestie of <hi>Vesta.</hi> And <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> the like in honour of all the Gods: <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the better to expresse that God was eternall, commanded his Schollers that so oft as they accommodated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the worship of God, they should turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues round.

               <p>WIthin these hundred yeares many nations haue beene discouered and many are disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered still which were vnfound in former ages. Amongst them some haue beene found to liue without law, without King, but yet none without

What moued the <hi>Brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> and the <hi>Magies</hi> amongst the <hi>Persians,</hi> to begin and end their vndertakings with prayers to God?

What moued <hi>Attillius Regulus</hi> (who had no other teacher then a naturall illumination) to preferre the obligation of his oath before the safty of his life, and rather then he would breake his ingaged word and promise to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> expose himselfe to all the torments that the cruelty and malice of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could inflict vpon him? what moued the <hi>Sagun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> a people of <hi>Arragon</hi> to that vndaunted resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs, who hauing plighted their faith and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty by solemne oath to the <hi>Romans,</hi> chose rather to entombe themselues voluntarily in a fire which they made in their Market place, then to breake their faith to the said <hi>Romans</hi> which they had so solemnly swore and sacredly avowed vnder their protection? what, I say, could moue these meere naturalists to such a feare of an oath; to such a trembling at Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to such austerity, and care, and censorious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection in all their waies and actions, but that they naturally apprehended what they truly &amp; distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly vnderstood not, <hi>viz:</hi> Some immortall happinesse

               <p>Certainely they would never haue so much vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued their earthly contentments, and sold all the comforts of this life (as some of them did) at so cheap a rate, but that they trusted to some future rest of more enduring substance after this life, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expected the immortall fruition of such ioyes as should abundantly countervaile the losse of all their pleasures. When I revolue in my minde the <hi>Stoicall</hi> reseruednesse, the moderation, the vnconquerable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of these miserable <hi>Heathens,</hi> when I see <hi>Cleombro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in hope of immortalitie to tumble himselfe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily downe a hill, when I see <hi>Socrates</hi> smile vpon his hemlocke, and sullen <hi>Scevola</hi> burne off his owne hand without euer gnashing his teeth at it, when I see <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> scorne his owne life because his enimie gaue it him, and teare off the salue from his bleeding sides, which his owne sword had peirced: When I thus behold these vnhappy soules in the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to conquer nature it selfe, and to build these their resolutions vp≈ç no other ground but the slender hope of some vnknowne contentment in the life to come, me thinkes these magnanimous acts of theirs howeuer they are not for the imitation of vs <hi>Christians,</hi> yet doe they tend to our condemnation. Their hope did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their knowledge, &amp; our knowledge doth exceed our practise. God hath revealed to vs the immortality of the soule, and the eternity to come, in a farre more

Wee readily apprehend such things as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne vs in this world: our honours, our preferments, our pleasures we looke on with a cheerefull eye: but alas with how slow and dull a pace doe we proceed in the pursuit of our future blessednesse? wee meet with many stops in our way, many turnings in our iourney: and the truth is wee must not expect to arriue at so happy a hauen without some stormes; but what are these to Eternitie that long day that shall neuer shut in; that <hi>vnum perpetuum hodie,</hi> that beginning ever in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, in which the blessed doe euerlastingly enioy their happinesse, and renew their pleasures, and the damned are alwaies dying yet never dye? O that the meditation of this our future state could sinke deepe enough into our hearts, that we would make that the obiect of our thoughts here, which must be the obiect of our accounts hereafter, that the sense of our sinnes were the chiefe matter of our sorrowes, then should we enioy an eternitie hereafter boundlesse for time, endlesse for happinesse, where our ioyes should bee such, as should neither change nor perish.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Explaining how Nature hath represented and shaddowed out Eternity to vs in some of the creatures.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw to the end wee should bee the farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged vnto the inquisition of eternity, God hath not only planted the knowledge hereof in the hearts of the <hi>Heathens</hi> but hath also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented it in the nature of the creatures. For if wee search with a narrow eye into the secrets of nature, how many things shall wee finde in the world; as liuely resemblances, shadowing as it were, and trace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out vnto vs this eternity? <hi>Solinus</hi> reports of a stone in <hi>Arcadia</hi> which being once inflamed burnes perpetually. And of this matter were your burning lampes made, which continued (as <hi>Histories</hi> speake) so many hundreth yeares in ancient Sepulchers. Like herevnto in the nature of it is your <hi>Linum vivum,</hi> a certaine kinde of linnen knowne in <hi>India</hi> which is vncombustible, nay it is not only, not consumed by the fire but it is as it were cleansed and washed &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the heate thereof; and hence it was that the body of the ancient <hi>Romane Emperors</hi> when they were to be buried according to the funerall rites of those times, were shrouded vp into such linuen to preserue their ashes and to avoide a confusion and mixture of their bodies with common dust.</p>
               <p>Behold, here nature it selfe suggests an eternity to thy soule, while it presents to thee such things as the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:176708:11"/> fire cannot consume, many other such <hi>Symboles</hi> and representations of immortality may bee found in the booke of the creatures. The <hi>Salamander</hi> liueth in the fire and perisheth not, those famous hills in <hi>Sicily</hi> haue beene on fire continually, beyond the memory of man, and yet remaine whole and vnconsumed. The like we reade, of that <hi>Oleum incombustibile</hi> (as <hi>Historians</hi> call it) an oyle that ever burnes, but will never waste, &amp; of the matter of this was that burning torch composed, which was found in <hi>Tulliola,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Cicero</hi> her sepulcher: which continued burning fifteene hundreth yeares. These and many other shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and traces of eternity, <hi>God</hi> hath vouchsafed vs to stirre vp our dead and drowsy hearts to a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act inquisition and serious consideration of the time to come. For in the booke of the creature wee may see the power of the <hi>Creator</hi> and out of these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar workes of his we may vnderstand that, that <hi>God</hi> which hath endowed nature with such admirable qualities can giue the flesh also such a condition, that it shall endure according to his mercifull dispensation either torments or happinesse for evermore.</p>
               <p>Now then to draw all this to an issue, since it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true that <hi>God</hi> hath provided an everlasting being for the soules of men in the world to come: since he hath engrauen the knowledge hereof as with an Iron pen in the consciences of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> since he hath giuen vs so many liuely resemblances and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof in the secrets of nature, and in the workes of his creation, Oh how should the meditation of this take vp our deepest thoughts, our refinest affections?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176708:11"/> how should this cause vs to reflect vpon our soules; to ponder our waies and with an vndazeled and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling eye throughly to trye and to descry cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our owne state, whether we be already washed with the blood of <hi>Christ</hi> and enliuened with a supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vigour and life of grace, or yet ly polluted in our owne blood?</p>
               <p>Oh, how can any man be at rest and quiet in his minde, till he be assured and secured in this point; since that vpon it depend his everlasting estate in another world? our daies wee see are wouen with a slender thred, our time short, our end vncertaine, and when the oyle in our lampes is spent, and our glasse runne out, then <hi>ex vnico momento pendet duplex aeternitas,</hi> we fly in a moment to an everlasting being either in horror or happinesse, where wee shall receiue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the workes of our hands. If wee haue appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our selues sincere in <hi>Gods</hi> service, iust in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diligent in our callings, faithfull in our promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, wee shall then attaine the end of our faith, the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our soules; and the conscience of our well spent life, shall at that dismall day replenish our soules with abundance of consolations.</p>
               <p>Then all our teares shall bee wiped from our eyes; what we haue sowed in sorrow, we shall reape in ioy, when we haue finished our course &amp; ended our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with sinne and death: then shall our crowne bee sure, our victory glorious, and our triumph <hi>Eternall;</hi> our graue shall be but as a sweet refreshing place to our wearied bodies, and death shall be our day starre to everlasting brightnesse.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:176708:12"/>
               <p>But on the other side; if wee haue in the whole course of our warfare here, expended our pretious time in the service of sinne and Sathan, and crumbled away the best and choicest of our yeares in the lusts of the flesh, and sports of vanity; then the issue of all will be death, and our end destruction. Our mirth wil be turned into wormewood, and our ioy into heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: all our delights in this earth shall vanish as the flower, our sun shall set in a cloud, and our daies of iol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and contentation shall irrecoverably be involued and turned into perpetuall darknesse.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:176708:12"/> or peculiar paine, but in the accumulation &amp; heap of innumerable torments together. All the faculties of the soule, all the senses of the body shall haue their seuerall punishments, and that which is more, vnsepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and more then that, eternall: There shall bee no degrees in their torments, but the least shal be infinite. For as the wrath and displeasure of <hi>God</hi> toward them is everlasting, so shall their pressures be. They enioy an <hi>eternity</hi> like the <hi>Saints,</hi> but not the <hi>Saints eternity;</hi> for their eternity shall beginne in horror, and proceed in confusion: their eternity shall purchase and yeeld to them no other fruit but yellings and lamentations, &amp; woe. Their <hi>eternity</hi> is such as turnes all things into its owne nature: for all things where the damned doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit are eternall. The fire is eternall: for the breath of God like a riuer of brimstone hath kindled it, and it shall neuer goe out night nor day; but the smoake thereof shall ascend for euer. The worme is eternall, for the conscience of the damned shall be everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tormented with the sense of their sinne: Their worme dieth not, (saith the <hi>Prophet</hi>) and their fire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goeth out. The prison wherein they are inclosed is eternall. The ptayers of the <hi>Church</hi> could open the prison doores to <hi>Peter,</hi> but no prayers can pierce these walls, no power can ouerthrowe them, no time can ruine them; out of Hell is no redemption, no ransome, no deliuery, <hi>Cruciantur damnati, cruciantur in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> This is the last sentence of the <hi>Iudge,</hi> his irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable decree, his immutable and eternall <hi>Iudgement</hi> vpon the damned, which shall neuer bee reuersed:<note place="margin">Adesse intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile, abesse impossibile.</note> * there is no appeale will lye from this <hi>Iudge;</hi> there is

The blood of <hi>Christ</hi> shed on <hi>Golgotha,</hi> is fully sufficient to saue all man-kinde, but it belongs not to the damned. If therefore the yoake of repentance seeme not sweet to thee (saith S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Bernard</hi>) thinke on that yoake which thou shalt be sure to suffer, which is Goe yee cursed into eternal fire. But the most deplorable thing which is eternall in hell is, the irrevocable losse of the beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall presence of <hi>God,</hi> the eternall priuation of <hi>Gods</hi> sight, the vncomfortable want whereof, doth more grieue their hearts, and wound their afflicted soules, then all their bodily torments. Thus wee see the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy estate and condition of the damned in the other world, and how the highest linke in all this chaine of sorrowes, wherewith they are enuironed, is the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perpetuitie of their torments, when their rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thoughts haue carefully runne through many thousands of yeares, yet will they not then enioy one day, one little houre, one minute of rest and respirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Can the knowledge of these things swim in our braine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ferious and sound digestion of them into our hearts? when we see, and knowe, and beleeue, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable, eternall, endlesse, easelesse horrors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true and vnfained repentance, abide vs hereafter; and on the other side we knowe not, nor can possibly discerne with how speedy and swift a foot our end approacheth, nor how suddenly wee shall be summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue the world our euerlasting farwell; How can so sad and important a consideration as this, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse our thoughts and not torment them? or how can this chuse but imbitter our dearest pleasures, &amp; crosse our indulgence to our sensuall affections? Did we but reason a while with our soules, and euery one of vs in a particular application say within himselfe: I am here floating like a ship in the sea of this world ballased on every side with the cares and disquietings &amp; pressures of this life, and I sayle on with full course towards the hauen of Eternity, one little blast of death is able to plunge me irrecouerably into this bottomelesse gulfe, where one houres torment will infinitely exceed (for the paine of it) an hundred yeares bitter repentance. And shall I now thus standing vpon the very battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell, melt in my delights, cheere vp my selfe in the dayes of my youth, shall I tyre out my spirits, trifle out my pretious time, rob mine eyes of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued sleepe for such things, to the which the time will come, when I must bid an euerlasting farewell? Me thinks the thorough meditation of our future state
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:176708:14"/> should euen strangle our sensuall ioyes in vs, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe our hearts from the embracements of this world, especially when wee shall to our endlesse sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row vnderstand, our dearest contents must close at the last in death and confusion, and all our precedent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures shall yeeld vs no other fruit but their bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to augment our sorrowes.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NOW here ariseth a question to bee resolved; how comes it to passe, that our mercifull and gratious <hi>God,</hi> who is so infinite in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and so abundant in his loue, whose praises the Prophet <hi>David</hi> amplifies in his 136. psalme, twenty seauen times together, with this conclusion; <hi>for his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> how can it stande, that this our God, whole mercy is thus exalted aboue all his workes, should be thus infinitely mercifull, and yet so infinitely iust too, as to inflict vpon a finite sinne an infinite punishment, that he should continue milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of yeares, yea to <hi>everlastingnesse,</hi> in the avenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those sinnes which were committed as it were in a moment of time, so that hee who hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

I answere, wee shall sufficiently vin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dicate and cleare <hi>Gods</hi> righteous dealing towards vs herein, if wee measure his iustice but by our owne rules: * for doth any law proporti√≤n out the time of<note place="margin">Scelus non temporis lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudine sed iniquiratis magnitudine metiendum est. <hi>Aug. de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitat.

                  </note> punishment to the time only in which the offence is commited, and so measure the continuance of the pennalty by the time of the fault? Shall the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner lye no longer in the Goale, then he is committing his villanie? Doe not wee here amongst vs often see some offences which were suddenly thought of and as soone executed, yet punished with endlesse date<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse banishments, which in comparison to this life beare a proportion with eternity? Now if the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of man doth follow this rule in proportioning of punishments, weighing offences by the fowlenes of the fact, Shall wee denie <hi>God</hi> the righteous <hi>Iudge</hi> of all the world the same liberty over the workes of his owne hands? Againe if this will not satisfie our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitiue mindes, let vs but take our owne hearts to taske, and sifte them to the bottome, and impartially weigh what a world of pollution and deceipte and perversenesse is lodged in them, and then certainely wee shall finde matter enough against our selues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther inquiry for our endlesse condemnation: our owne consciences will testify to the confusion of our faces, that iust is the <hi>Lord,</hi> and iust are his <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:176708:15"/>
                  <hi>Gods</hi> Iustice being infinite, the violation thereof by sinne must needs contract an infinite debt; because in sinning we rob God of his glory, which wee must needs repaie him againe: Now the satisfaction of an infinite debt, must needs bee infinite either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of time or measure; And because a finite vessell is not able to hold or comprehend an infinite wrath forasmuch as wee cannot beare <hi>Gods</hi> indignation, <hi>propter immensitatem doloris,</hi> wee must of necessity satisfie his Iustice, <hi>duratione temporis;</hi> the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our sufferings must supply what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the weight of our punishments.

Oh let not then sinfull flesh contend with its maker, let not vs prye into the heavens, nor curiously search into the secrets of <hi>Gods</hi> will, to finde a reason of the obligation of a sinner to perpetuall punishment, but rather in the lowlines of our heartes crie out with <hi>Daniell, O Lord</hi> righteousnesse belongs vnto thee, but to vs open shame, because wee haue rebelled against thee: let vs cast downe our soules at the foote of his grace, and humbly acknowledge in the sence of our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:176708:15"/> deformities, that just is the <hi>Lord,</hi> &amp; just are his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Our weake vnderstandings can no way fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome the depth of his counsells; his wisdome is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable and all his waies are truth: but did we truly apprehend the nature of our sinnes, wee would never repine at the weight of <hi>Gods</hi> Iudgements, for whereas <hi>God</hi> made man a noble creature, both beautifull and glorious, and after stamped on him his owne Image, righteousnesse and true holinesse, how strangely hath his sinne disrobed him of all his excellencies, what rebellion hath it setled in all his members, what staines and pollutions hath it wrought in all his faculties? It is our sinne which hath vnioynted the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and societies of the dumbe creatures, and hath armed them with an antipathy and rebellion one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another. It is sinne which hath so strangely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the manners and conditions of our times, that hath turned mens browes into brasse, and their hearts into stones, and their hands into blood, and their tongues into Scorpions it. Is sin which hath wrought such a confusion and Chaos in all things vnder the Sunne, which hath changed truth into flattery, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances into formes, nature into arte, decency into new fanglednesse, renting of hearts into cutting of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is sinne I say which in this our age hath dissolued those sweete obligations of peace and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency, which were formerly knitte betweene our neighbour nations, and insteede thereof hath sent in, fire and sword amongst them; &amp; that hath rowled vp within these few yeares so many Noble spirits in those parts into blood and destruction. And lastly it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:176708:16"/> is our sin that shall at that last &amp; dreadfull day turne the very Elements into fire, and the whole frame of this world with all the things therein, into their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Chaos and Originall Confusion.</p>
               <p>Oh that wee did seriously consider of, and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digest the meditation of these things! For had wee but hearts to vnderstande, and eyes to see the deformity of our sinnes and did vnpartially compare the staine and pollution of them with the purenesse of <hi>Gods</hi> nature, and the brightnesse of his Maiesty, how should wee be confounded in our soules, with the sight of our owne filthinesse? How ready should we be rather to admire <hi>Gods</hi> patience then question his severity? How should wee tremble at his glorious presence; and dread his power, and iustly feare what wee haue worthily deserued, his everlasting iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, since our pollutions haue moved him to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the workes of his owne hands and to distaine the beauty of his owne creation? But if now on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side wee advisedly looke into <hi>Gods</hi> gratious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings towards vs, and his louing indulgence in restraining his incensed displeasure, notwithstanding our infinite provocations, and in shewing vs a way to escape his fury; I know not whether wee shall finde greater cause to vindicate his justice, or admire his mercy. For true it is, as saith Saint <hi>Agustine,</hi> * Soe<note place="margin">Deus adeo bonus est vt malum nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam sineret nisi adeo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens fuisset; vt ex malo bonum elice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Good</hi> is our <hi>God,</hi> that he would never haue suffered vs to fall had not his power bene such, that hee could extract matter out of our sinfulnesse to advance his owne glory. Oh how vnsearchable, how botomlesse, how surpassing the apprehension of men and Angells
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:176708:16"/> is the loue of <hi>God</hi> towards vs! whither can wee goe? which way can wee cast our eyes, where wee shall not behold the admirable foote-steps of his mercy? If wee looke vpward, his mercy reacheth vnto the Heavens, saith <hi>David:</hi> If downeward, they that goe downe into the deepe see the wonders of <hi>God,</hi> saith the same <hi>Prophet,</hi> and his mercies in the great waters. If round about vs, those that put their trust in the <hi>Lord,</hi> mercy embraceth them on every side. And hence it is that the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> so diversly amplifies the loue of <hi>God</hi> in severall places of that Epistle, by sundry appellations or epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites, as his loue, his greate loue, his abundant loue, his loue passing knowledge: againe, the riches of his glory, the riches of his grace, the riches of his mercy; <hi>God</hi> who is mercifull saith the Apostle, who is rich in mercy through his loue, his great loue, even when wee were dead by sinnes hath quickned vs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Christ Eph.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
               <p>The Apostle also in the same Epistle and first chapter expresseth the Lord, great in his power, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in his wisdome, but rich, exceeding rich in his mercy. And why rich in mercy only? Is not the Lord rich in <hi>Angells,</hi> rich in the <hi>Saints,</hi> rich in the <hi>Heavens?</hi> Hath he not created the Cloudes, founded the Seas, wisely composed the whole frame of nature? And is he yet rich only in mercy? True it is; the earth is the Lords and the fulnesse thereof, all that wee haue, all that wee are, is his; but his mercy hath an excellency in it aboue all his creatures; yea (if I may so speake) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all his attributes, aboue his Iustice; Mercy (saith
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:176708:17"/> the Apostle) reioyceth against condemnation: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his power; <hi>Iacob</hi> wrestled with God and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him; aboue his greatnes; for he h≈´bled himselfe to take our nature on him; yea aboue all his earthly creatures; for his mercy reacheth to the Cloudes, there is nothing doth more illustrate <hi>Gods</hi> omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency then his mercy. It was noe marvaile that <hi>God</hi> should make the Heauens because hee is power it selfe, or that he should frame the earth; because hee is strength it selfe, or that he should governe the times because he is wisdome it selfe, or that he should giue breath to all creatures, because he is life it selfe; But herein chiefly is <hi>God</hi> to be magnified, that hee who is infinitely iust, should yet bee mercifull to sinners; yea to sinners while they wallow in their blood; while they rest in sinnes, while they haue no eye to looke after him, no heart to embrace him, no foote to follow him, no tongue to glorifie him, but lye woeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plunged in the dregs of their pollutions? Oh the vnspeakable goodnesse of our <hi>God,</hi> who hath so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously invited those sheepe, who are so vnhappily strayed from him: nay who doth with a * louing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence<note place="margin">Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissima facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate homines ad seipsum convertit Deus, &amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes ex no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentibus facit. <hi>Aug. ad vita.</hi>
                  </note> irresistably call those who haue trampled on his graces, and reiected his loue. But what should moue the creator of all things who hath beene thus infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked, who is armed both with power to strike; and meanes to be avenged, to compassionate his enimies? Certainely there is, there can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason alleadged, but that which <hi>David</hi> so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten iterates, <hi>because he is gratious, &amp; his mercy endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever.</hi> But alas how (may the afflicted soule
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:176708:17"/> say) can his goodnesse extend to mee who am nothing but wormes and dust, and woundes and sores and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? Who can giue him no oblation but my sinnes, no sacrifice but my sorrow? What confidence now can I haue in this loue, what strength in this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? Who ever thou art, that art thus, and no better disposed to receiue the grace of thy God, bring forth this small provision, offer this sacrifice vpon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Since thou hast nothing else to part with surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vp thy sinnes, yeeld him thy lusts, renounce thy whole interest in thy sinfull delights, in thy immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate affections * and then thy sorrowfull spirit shall<note place="margin">Nullius rei tantum in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferno est, quantum pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priae volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. <hi>Alsted.</hi>

He is faithfull saith the Apostle, who hath promised; hee is faithfull, hee cannot deny himselfe. The Apostle saith not, hee cannot deny his mercy, but hee cannot deny himselfe. If hee were any thing but mercy, then hee might deny his mercy, though hee did not deny himselfe: but now by not denying himselfe he giueth mercy, who by not giuing mercy should deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.

All states and conditions of men are alike, when they appeare at this Barre. There the prince must lay downe his crowne, and the Peare his Robes, &amp; the iudge his purple, and the Captaine his banner; All must promiscuously attend to giue in their accounts and to receiue according to that they haue done, whether it bee good or whether it be evill. Here on earth great men and glorious in the eye of the world, so long as they can hold their habitations in the earth, haue both countenance to defend, and power to protect them from the iniuries of the times: but when the dismall face of that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble day shall shew it selfe, then shall they finde no eye to pitty, nor arme to helpe, nor palace to defend, nor rockes to shelter, nor Mountaines to cover them

The serious and advised consideration of this eternall being in the life to come, was the ground of that ancient custome in the <hi>Romane Church</hi> vpon the consecration of their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> at which time these words were recited with a loud voice, <hi>Annos aeternos in mente habe, i. e.</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that eternall yeare, the date whereof will never
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:176708:23"/> expire. So likewise when the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is brought to his pontificall chaire, one goes before him, shaking a burning torch and proclaiming three times <hi>Pater sancte, sic transit gloria mundi.</hi> Certainly it would worke somewhat towards the enliuening of our drowsinesse, &amp; quickning vp of our dull security if we didin the beginning &amp; end of all our vndertakings say within our selues, <hi>Annos aeternos in mente habe;</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member √¥ my soule those daies of darknesse which shall neuer close. For all the pressures and vexing distempers, that befall vs in this life; all the crosses, which the envy either of men or evill Angells can throw vpon vs, are nothing, if compared to eternall miseries. <hi>Sapienti nihil magnum videri potest, cui aeternitatis nota est magnitudo.</hi> What if with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> I vnderwent labours &amp; perills, hunger &amp; thirst, iniuries and reproaches, what is all this to eternity?</p>
               <p>What if I did beare in my flesh the most exquisite paines and bitterest torments, that created nature is capable of, yet what were all this to eternity? For all the adversities and alterations, which happen to vs vnder the sunne, haue their periods, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not passe: however they disquiet vs for the time, yet as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> saith, <hi>the end shall bee at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time,</hi> God will performe that which he hath appointed for me saith <hi>Iob:</hi> yet <hi>vs{que} ad tempus haec om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> the end shall be at the appointed time. But of this eternity there will be no end, no bounds can limit it, no time shall determine it. Certainly first or last, there will happen to thee such an evening as shall haue no
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:176708:24"/> morning to follow; or else such a morning, as shall never see the close of the Sunne: And therefore let not the vanishing cares and transitory disquietings of this world over deepely possesse thy heart; but rather let the whole streame of thy meditations runne vpon thy latter end; that at the time of thy dissolution; (thy affection being wholy alienated from the world) thy thoughts may ascend before, whither thy soule is comming after: So shall thy sufferings here, make way for thy crowne hereafter.</p>
               <p>But how few, √¥ how few I say are there that weigh these things? How few doe make it their daily taske to meditate on the evills to come? They credit not such reports; for they care not to beleeue what they are vnwilling to practise. Hence it is that they goe on so securely in their course, as if there were no heauen, no hell, no <hi>God,</hi> no eternity. Thus wee naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, our daies should be as happy as they are longe, and being miserably insensible of the sorrowes to come, wee rashly expose our selues to an irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">Nos tales, qui mortis nostrae ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotium ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu imur. <hi>Greg.</hi>

O how different are our times from those of our Ancestors? They were not more rigidly superstitious, then we are vainely secure.</p>
               <p>How did they pine their bodies and afflict their soules, crucify their most pretious lusts, forsake their friends, their lands, their inheritance, yea their Crownes, and Kingdomes; nay which is more, through the rigid and austeere obseruation of their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:176708:24"/> strict and severe lawes expose themselues to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and danger of their dearest liues, and thrust themselues as it were out of the world, and forgoe all society with men. And wherefore all this, but that they might disburthen themselues the better by these meanes from all earthly allurements; settle and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their hearts in a good preparation towards their home; and to enliuen their affections, and inflame their mindes to a more serious contemplation of the ioyes to come? Mee thinkes the consideration of these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times should strongly invite vs to a more serious meditation of our future state; especially if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how swiftly our daies draw to an end, and how soone we are involued into everlasting dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For alas what is our life here, <hi>Tota haec vita v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius horulae mors est,</hi> one houre at the last will swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vp all our liue-long daies.</p>
               <p>Let vs then not feare being so neare our home; let no stormes affright vs being so neare our haven: Let vs examine our accounts and cast vp our summes, that we may be able to giue vp a good account at the last day. Certaine it is what ever we goe about; whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the scope of our endeavours; wee every day come nearer to the end of our course, every houre is a new step onward.</p>
               <p>So soone as ever a man enters this mortall life, hee beginnes a constant iourney vnto death, <hi>quicquid temporis vivitur de spatio vivendi tollitur: i. e.</hi> Each part of time that wee passe, cuts off so much from our life, and the remainder still decreaseth; So that our whole life is nothing but a course or passage vnto
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:176708:25"/> death, wherein one can neither stay nor slacke his pace. This wee know, our daily experience doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this truth: and yet doe wee persist as securely as ever in our trade of sinne: <hi>AEgrae abstrahimur ab ijs quibus assuescimus, i. e.</hi> wee are hardly drawne from those things which custome and time hath invred vs vnto. It is a grievous burthen to a licentious heart to be drawne off from dainty fare, full cups, and good company. Wee lye as dead men and sencelesse in our damned pollutions, even drowned in our voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, like brute beasts filled vp and pampered for the day of slaughter. Thus with the full streame of our indeauours we plod on in the habituall course of transgressing, without any sense of our sinne, vntill our short daies begin to shut in, and our evening ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; at which time the weaknesse of our bodies, and the strength of our sinnes make vs as vnable to repent, as wee were before vnwilling.

The world is our sea, but <hi>Christ</hi> is our haven; the world is our warfare, but <hi>Christ</hi> is our rest: The world is full of stormes, but <hi>Christ</hi> is our peace; in me you shall haue peace.

Hence it was that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> so resolutely brake forth; <hi>Hic vre, hic seca, mod√≤ in aeternum parcas;</hi> he regarded not what pressures God laid vpon him, So he vouchsafed him patience here and heaven hereafter. What ever we doe or can suffer in this life, the abundance of our eternall ioy shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely recompence the weight of our sorrowes: Our light afflictions which are but for a moment doe cause vnto vs a farre more excellent and exceeding weight of glory. Our combat here is short, but our triumph eternall. And who would not endure a few crosses &amp; windings in his way when he knowes they will bring him to his journies end?

               <p>Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath an excellent expression to this purpose: Suppose a man, saith he, much desiring sleepe, and in his perfect mind, had an offer made him of one nights sweete rest, vpon condition to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished a hundred yeares for it, would he accept (thinke you) of his sleepe vpon such tearmes? Now looke what one night is to an hundred yeares, the same is the life present, compared with that to come. Nay looke what a drop of water is to the sea; the same and no more is a thousand yeares to eternity. Who then of sound judgement, for the short fruition of a transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory contentment in this life, would expose himselfe to the horror of eternall flames in the life to come? And therefore whiles wee haue our abode in this vale of misery, we should alwaies pray with Saint <hi>Bernard, da domine, vt sic possideamus temporalia, vt non perda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:176708:26"/> aeterna, i. e.</hi> grant vs <hi>Lord</hi> that wee may so partake of temporall felicities, that wee may not loose eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. All things vnder the Sunne haue their alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and changings, but things aboue are permanent, and of an enduring substance. <hi>Omnia ei salua sunt, cui salva est beata aeternitas;</hi> hee that can be secure, and sure of the happinesse to come, builds vp his house vpon a firme foundation. How small a modell of time, how short a period is the longest life, when once it is finished? Recollect with thy selfe, saith Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> the yeares that are passed from <hi>Adams</hi> time vntill now; run over the whole scripture, and the time since the fall will seeme but as yesterday. For what are the times past? If thou hadst liued from <hi>Adams</hi> day till this houre; thou wouldst easily haue judged, that this life hath no perpetuity in it, which flies away so swiftly. For what is the life of any man, suppose the longest age? It is but like the morning dew, like the twinkling of an eye, in a trice it is gone. I haue seene an end of all perfection saith <hi>David.</hi> But here o Christian, let me deale more plainely with thee; thou wilt readily acknowledge all things vnder the frame of Heaven are perishing, and heauen is thy thought, Eternity is thine ayme. Now if it bee so, why art thou then so dul in thy course of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so frozen in thy zeale, so inclinable to every motion of sinne, so easily ouercome by euery incitement to wantonnesse, never more calme and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably patient, then when thy affections should be enflamed, and thy heart kindled with a iust indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Gods cause: and on the other side neuer more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:176708:27"/> fretting, whining and vnquiet, then when thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest be meeke and patient, and cheerefully disposed vnder the burden of of afflictions? How can it be that we should haue eternity in our mindes, and yet liue no better in our manners? Now that we may the easier discerne the deceitfulnesse of our hearts herein; let vs examine our selues by the example of <hi>Iacob.</hi> This <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch Iacob</hi> serued his vncle <hi>Laban</hi> seauen yeares for <hi>Rachell</hi> his daughter, and the greatnesse of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to wards her, made that time seeme but as a few dayes. (to apply this:) Thou art a seruant as <hi>Iacob</hi> was, but thou serues not such a Master as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, thou serues not man but God, thy maker and a faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder; thou serues not for a wife, but for a kingdome; not for an earthly contentation, but for an heauenly habitation: And yet behold the short affliction of one day can eneruate thy loue, and vnlocke thy affections from God and heauen: Euery crosse accident stops thee in thy course, Euery little sorrow disquiets thy soule, and lessens thy contentment. Behold here, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by the example of <hi>Iacob</hi> the strength of thy loue: <hi>Iacob</hi> could serue seauen yeares with chearefulnesse for a wife, but thou canst hardly serue thy <hi>God</hi> so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes with a true affection for heauen: For reckon vp all the nights thou hast spent in prayer, summe vp all the dayes that thou hast worne out in religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, and canst thou then truly say to <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> did to his vncle, in thy seruice night and day haue I macerated my body with heat and cold, and my sleep departed from mine eyes; twenty yeares haue I labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in thy seruice: couldst thou say thus, and say it tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:176708:27"/> √¥ then what would be the end of thy labour, what would thy reward be? not flocks and cattell, not the daughters of <hi>Laban,</hi> but God himselfe would be thy exceeding great reward, thy life and happinesse; Hee would be vnto thee every thing that thy heart can desire or long for; Thy soule should flowe, and even melt in abundance of spirituall delights.</p>
               <p>But now take a little view of thine owne vilenesse, thy owne nakednesse, thy vttter disability to any thing that may be truly called good. Thy hands are feeble to Gods worke, thy feete are slow to Gods temple, thine eyes are seared or shut vp towards heaven; But for the workes of flesh and Sathan, thy heart is hot to envy, thy minde prone to revenge, thy tongue vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble to blaspheame, thy affections even glued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated as it were into the sensuall embracements; And is this to serue God for heaven? shall the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and the glory of <hi>Angells,</hi> and the ioy, and fruition of <hi>God</hi> himselfe bee powred forth vpon such workes as these? Dost thou thus requite thy maker.</p>
               <p>O consider, consider I say thy waies in time; labour to serue <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> did: labour to approue thy selfe as faithfull to <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> was to his vnckle <hi>Laban:</hi> And if the weight of the labour discourage thee, or adversity oppresse thee, or prosperity seduce thee; then lift vp thine eyes to heaven, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did to his <hi>Rachell:</hi> Let heauen be thy loue, thy spouse, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of thine eyes, the ioy of thy heart; Behold thy <hi>Rachell</hi> is faire, and louely, heaven is both beautifull and glorious: Let thy desires goe before whither thou
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:176708:28"/> meanest to hasten after: suffer for a season thy light affliction, hauing an eye to the recompence of reward; yet and but a little while, and thou shalt approach the haven, where thou shalt enioy so much the more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,<note place="margin">E√≤ dirigendus est spiritus quo aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do est iturus.</note> by how much the deeper thou hast drunke in sorrow; and by how much the more ardent thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions haue beene towards <hi>God</hi> in this life, the more abundant shall thy reward be in the life to come; then shall thy crosses proue thy gaines, and that well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of ioy which shall ever rise in thy heart, shall swallow vp all thy sorrowes.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:176708:29"/> will. O the infinite &amp; in expressible tendernesse of our louing Sauiour towards vs! When we, like sheepe, had gone astray, his mercy reduced vs: When we lay wallowing in our blood, his pitty refresht vs: When we were dead in our sinnes, his death did reuiue vs: and here we may truely say with <hi>David, his mercy reacheth to the heauens.</hi> We were not, neither could we be redeemed by the blood of bulls and goats, by thousands of riuers of oyle, by the cattle that are vpon a thousand mountaines. It was not the treasures of the world, the power of men or Angels could purchase this freedome, nothing could cleanse vs, but the blood of the <hi>Lambe:</hi> He was that fountaine, opened for sinne and for vncleanesse; He was that <hi>Sonne of righteousnes,</hi> that came with healing in his wings. His were the wounds, that healed our sores; his was the backe, that bare our sorrowes; his was the price, that quit our skores; he assumed our flesh to redeeme vs here, and he raignes as a king to crowne vs hereafter. Now what remaines after all this to be done on our parts? Let vs rest on this <hi>Anchor,</hi> let vs fly to this <hi>hold,</hi> and build on this <hi>foundation: For no other foundation can any man lay, then that which is laid, Iesus Christ.</hi> Let vs cast our soules into the armes of our <hi>Saviour: In brachijs Salvatoris mei &amp; vivere volo et mori cupio,</hi> saith S. <hi>Bernard:</hi> O let this bee our desire: Now the gate is open, let vs not deferre the time of entrance: Now is the acceptable time, let vs not procrastinate the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Now he offers his mercy, he shewes his long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, let vs not turne his grace into wantonnesse;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:176708:29"/> let vs follow the counsell of the sonne of <hi>Sirach:</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus the 5. <hi>Make no long tarrying to turne to the Lord,</hi> and put not off from day to day: For suddainly shall the wrath of the Lord breake forth, and in thy securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thou shalt bee destroyed, and thou shalt perish in time of vengeance. But alas farre otherwise it is with vs in our practise: * A great portion of our time is crumbled away in doing ill, a greater part in doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and our whole life in doing that, which wee should not, or in matters (as we say) vpon the by. And as <hi>Archimedes</hi> was secure and busie about drawing lines on the ground when <hi>Syracuse</hi> was taken; so is it with vs. Now that our eternall safety laies at stake, we lye puzling in our dust, I meane, in our worldly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations: But for our eternity shortly approaching, we seldome or rarely thinke of it. We are like <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> troubled about many things, when one thing is necessary: But this one thing is that, which of all other things is least regarded, and in the last place. Wee sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome seek heauen, till death doth summon vs to leaue the earth: wee haue many euasions to gull our owne hearts, many excuses to procrastinate our repentance; like <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the <hi>Scicilian</hi> king, who to excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for the present deliuery of the golden garment, which he tooke from his <hi>God Apollo,</hi> answered that such a robe as that was, could not bee at any season of the yeare vsefull to his God: it would not keepe him warme in the winter, &amp; it was too heauy for the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: So many there be, saith S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who play with God and with their owne soule. You must not (say they) seeke for the vigour and life of religion in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:176708:30"/> the hearts of young men; For youth, as the prouerbe is, must haue his swinge: Neither can you expect it in the company of the aged: for their age, and those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, which accompany it, make them a burden to themselues and dulls the edge of their intentions vnto all their serious vnderstandings. Thus both the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and the winter of our age are vnfit for Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But let vs not thus cheate our selues. If God bee God, let vs follow him; let vs not put off the day of reconciliation, and say in our hearts to morrow wee will doe it, when yet we cannot tell, what shall bee to morrow: for what is our life? It is euen a vapour, that appeares for a little time and afterwards vanisheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Hence it was that <hi>Macedonius,</hi> being inuited a day before to a feast, replied to the messenger, why doth thy Master inuite me for to morrow, whereas for this many yeares I haue not promised to my selfe one daies life? <hi>Nemo mortem satis cavet, nisi qui semper cavet. i. e.</hi> No man dreads death as he ought, but hee that alwaies expects his summons; and therefore wee may truly iudge such men wofully secure, and wilfull contemners of the future good, who can goe to their beds, and rest on their pillowes in the apprehension of their knowne sinnes, without a particular humiliation for them. For how oft doth a suddain &amp; vnexpected death arrest men? We see and knowe in our dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, many lay themselues to sleepe in health and safety, yet are found dead in the morning. Thus sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly are they wrapt from their quiet repose to their irrecouerable iudgement, perchance from their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to flames of fire; such is the frayle condition of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:176708:30"/> our brittle liues, within the small particle of an houre, liue and sicken, and dye: yet so grosse is our blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that from one day to another, nay from one yeare to another, wee triflingly put off the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our liues, vntill our last houre creepes on vs vnlookt for, and dragges vs to eternity.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> striuing with all his endeavours heart to turne to the Lord, bitterly complained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himselfe, <hi>Quamdiu, quamdiu, cras, cras? Quare non h√¢c hor√¢ finis turpitudinis meae?</hi> How long (saith he) o how long-shall I delude my soule with to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes repentance? Why should not this houre ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate my sinfulnesse? Wee are every minute at the brinke of death, and every houre, that wee passe through, might proue (for ought we know) the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our whole life, and the very close of our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Now if it should please God to take away our soules from vs this night, (as suddenly falls out to some) what would then become of vs? In what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity should wee be found? Whether amongst the damned, or the blessed? Happy were it for vs, if wee were but as carefull for the welfare of our soules, as wee are curious for the adorning of our bodies: if our clothes or faces doe contract any blot or soiling, wee presently endeavour to cleanse the same: But though our soules lye inthralled in the pollutions of sinne, this alas we feele not; it neither provokes vs to shame, nor moues vs to sorrow. Wherefore let vs looke into our hearts with a sevearer eye: Let the shortnesse of our daies stirre vs vp to the amendment of our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:176708:31"/> liues; &amp; let the houre, wherein we haue sinned, be the beginning of our reformation, according to that of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
                  <hi>Ambrose, agenda est paenitentia, non solum solicit√® ver√πm etiam matur√®, i. e.</hi> our repentance must be, not only sincere, but timely also, whilest wee haue the light, let vs walke as children of the light: Let vs not any longer cheate our soules in studying to invent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions or pretences for our sinnes; but rather lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our sores, and seeke to the true <hi>Physitian,</hi> that can heale them. All the creatures vnder the sunne doe naturally intend their owne preservation and desire that happinesse, which is agreeable to their nature: onely man is negligent, and impiously carelesse of his owne welfare. Wee see the Hart, when hee is stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and wounded, lookes speedily for a certaine hearbe, well knowne vnto him by a kinde of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall instinct; and when he hath found it, applies it to the wound. The swallow, when her young ones are blind, knowes how to procure them their sight by the vse of her Celandine: But wee alas are wounded, yet seeke for no remedy; wee goe customarily to our bedds, to our tables, to our good company; but who is he that obserues his constant course of praier, of repentance; of hearty, and sincere humiliation for his sinnes? Wee goe forward still in our old way, and jogge on in the same rode: Though our judgement hasten, hell threaten, death stand at the doore, yet we thrust onward still; <hi>&amp; in dulcem declinamus lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na somnum:</hi> But alas miserable soules as we are, can wee embrace quiet rests and vninterrupted sleepes with such wounded consciences? Can wee be so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:176708:31"/> being so neare our time?</p>
               <p>But you will say, wee haue passed already many nights without danger; no sicknesse in the night hath befalne vs hitherto, why then should any feare of death amaze or trouble vs?</p>
               <p>Admit all this, yea bee not too confident; one houre may effect that, which a thousand yeares could not produce: and thinke with your selues, what a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle distance there is, betweene your soules and death: Let me aske the strongest of men on earth, what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of life canst thou promise thy selfe, seeing that either a little bone in thy throat may choake thee, or a tile from thy house may braine thee, or some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ayre may poyson thee, and then where art thou? There are a thousand waies, whereby suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Tu te prius ad aeternita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem abrep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tum mirabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris qu√†m me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuares abripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum.</note> a man may come to his end; and certaine it is that; <hi>Mors illa maxime improvisa est, cuius vita praecedens non fuit provida, i. e.</hi> that death is the suddainest, which is not vshered in with a foregoing preparation. It is therefore a speciall point of wisdome to thinke every day our last, yea to account every houre the period of our liues. For looke how many pores there are in the body, so many windowes are there to let in death: yea we carry our deaths continually about vs in our bosomes; and who can promise himselfe his life till the evening? Hath not our owne experience showne vs many, whose sleepes in their beds haue proued sleepes vnto death; who haue beene carried from their chambers to their graue? Death doth not alwaies send forth her harbingers to giue notice of her comming; shee often presseth in vnlookt for, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:176708:32"/> suddainly attached the vnprovided soule. Watch therefore, because yee know neither the day, nor the houre: worke whilest yee haue the day; for the night comes, wherein no man can worke: looke towards thy evening; and cast thy thoughts vpon that long E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; Death first or last will apprehend thee: expect it therefore at every turne, and of this assure thy selfe, * <note place="margin">Qualis quis{que} in hac vita moritur, talis in die novissi mo iudicabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> as death leaueth thee, so shall iudgement finde thee. How improvidently secure then are those, who set vp their rest in the comforts of this life, and overly-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their eternall welfare? This is the generall care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse of our times.</p>
               <p>If a man haue a perpetuity but of fiue shillings yearely rent, what travell and paines and sweat, what beating of his braine and exhausting of his treasure will he runne through, before he will loose one dram of his right? Yet our eternall inheritance is cast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind vs, and vndervalued as a trifle, not worth the seeking; and this shewes our small loue to our home: for wee little esteeme of that, which wee take small paines for. All other things which conduce to our temporall well being, wee seeke with circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and enioy them with content; but matters of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> wee conceiue of, as things farre distant from vs, wee scarcely entertaine them in our thoughts. Wee busy not our vnderstandings in the search of those things which we see not: things present, and obvious to our sight doe best affect vs; wee are ill-sighted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, weake and dimme eyes haue wee towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>The truth of this appeares even in children, who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:176708:32"/> presently even from the cradle, drinke in the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vice; they learne to sweare, riot, drinke and the like enormities with the smallest teaching; but they are vtterly indisposed to any vertuous inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They soone apprehend what belongs to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity of behaviour, and deportment of the body, &amp; the fashions of the times; <hi>Hoc discunt omnes ante Alpha &amp; Beta puelli;</hi> but for Heaven and that Eternity, they are wholly averse from it, they are vtterly vncapable of the things aboue; they carry about them, as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their first parents, not only an indisposition, but a very opposition to goodnesse: And whereas for other imployments and vndertakings, they haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine naturall notions in them, bending their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to naturall workes, some one way and some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet they haue not so much as a naturall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the things of God. * Thus it is with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Homo sine gratia, praeter carnem nihil sapit, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git aut potest.</note> and thus it is with all men, even those of the ripest, and most peircing vnderstanding, vntill the light of <hi>Gods</hi> spirit hath shined on their hearts and powerfully wrought some spirituall, holy dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in them. <hi>The naturall man</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth, nor can discerne the things that are of God.</hi> O how infinitely-miserable and deplorable is his state, who hauing neither knowledge of the true life, nor possibility of himselfe to finde it out: * yet runnes<note place="margin">Cum ex ulfit a patria exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat in via.</note> on securely in his damned way, vntill he fall woeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and irrevocably into the pit, where hee will not haue, (no not when hee hath vncomfortably worne out millions of yeares) the least intermission of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or drop of comfort, or hope of pardon? Here
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:176708:33"/> on earth malefactors condemned to dye, haue this comfort (though wretched) that one houre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly terminates all their griefes in this life: But the torments of the damned are not concluded in an age; nay the end and period of ten thousand yeares will not end their sorrowe: And this is it which addes more to their sufferings, even their vnhappy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the perpetuity of them; they haue not so much as any hope of releasement.</p>
               <p>Hope in this life hath such a power in it, that it can yeeld some comfort in the middest of trouble; The sicke man, whilest his soule is in him, he hath hope, but after this life, this small refreshment is denied the damned, all their hope is turned into desperation. The Prophet <hi>Daniell,</hi> cap. 4. 14. heard the voice of an holy one, crying, <hi>hew downe the tree, and cut off his branches, shake of his leaues, and scatter his fruit, neuerthelesse leaue the stumpe of his roote in the earth.</hi> Thus it is with men in this world saith <hi>Ambrose,</hi> their leaues and their flowers are shaken; their delights are taken from them; but the rootes remaine, and their hope is not abolished. But it is not so in hell; (saith he) There both flower and stumpe; nay and even all hope too, are banished away from them. The day of the <hi>Lord,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> shall burne them vp, and leaue them neither roote nor branch. The very hope, saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> of the wicked shall perish; what should this teach vs, but whilest our hope remaines to improue our few daies to our best advantage, to make straighter paths to our selues, to abridge our inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate appetites in some measure of their vaine &amp; fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:176708:33"/> ioyes; and with all the power of our affections striue to attaine that hauen, where no billow shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright vs, no stormes astonish vs, no perills indanger vs? Then shall our dissolution proue our gaine, and our death our glory: if otherwise wee persist wilfully in the paths of our voluptuousnesse, and solace our selues in the vaine ioyes of our owne hearts, and in the sight of our eyes; certainly it will be bitternesse in the latter end. * <note place="margin">Extrema gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii luctus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupat.</note> All our earthly delights will glide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like a swift river: <hi>The reioycing of the wicked is short,</hi> saith <hi>Iob, and the ioy of a sinner is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Though his excellency mount vp to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and his head reach vnto the cloudes, yet shall he perish for ever like his dongue, but the righteous is like a strong mountaine and he shall bee had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting remembrance.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to draw to a conclusion, iust occasion might here be taken for deploring the negligence, and vnhappy condition of our times. Where are there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that take into their thoughts the due considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the time to come? Where shall wee finde any truly provident for immortality? <hi>Sic pleri{que} vivimus, ac si fabula esset omnis aeternitas;</hi> wee so liue as though wee conceiued of Eternity, but as of a fable, or a dreame; the sweete allurements of sin doe so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beguile many, that by gentle degrees they oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and extinguish in them all loue of vertue, and the very inclinations themselues to any thing, that may be truly tearmed good.</p>
               <p>But let vs no longer delude our selues by fancying a perpetuity on earth, behold the judge stands before
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:176708:34"/> the doore: ‚Ä† <note place="margin">Momento fi et quod tota doleat aeterni tas.

                  <head>The second conclusion.</head>
                  <p>The greatest part of men doe not belieue this Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which shall vndoubtedly follow either in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:176708:34"/> or Hell to all; For were they assured of that truth, they would shew more evident proofe thereof in the reformation of their liues. Some indeede will seeme to credit it in their words, but deny it in their actions. Their apprehensions and conceits may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance sometimes glance at it, vpon some checke of conscience, it being as a thorne in their sides, and a mountaine in their way towards their earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; but they are soone taken off. Such thoughts haue no rooting in the ground of their hearts, but are suddenly choaked by some intervenient imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: they are commonly nipt in their very bud, and killed in their birth; So that they neuer come to any issue. Thus many there are, who ‚Ä† <note place="margin">Caeci ad aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit tem ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, ex qua nunquam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibunt.</note> runne headlong and blindfold to their long home, like the rich glutton in the Gospell, which never began to open his eyes and looke vpwards, till he was in torment: All the while he liued on earth, his eyes were shut vp, and when it was too late, namely when he was throwne to hell, then began he to looke vpward and about him: And certainely it is no marvaile, this rich glutton, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more like him, hasten thus vnhappily to their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable downefall.</p>

                  <p>Whosoeuer shall descend into himselfe, and take a strict and serious view of this eternity, certainly the meditation thereof soundly digested, cannot but terminate his desires to a moderate and sparing frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even of lawfull contentments.</p>

                  <p>It is recorded of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that after his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead, he was never seene to laugh; The streame of his affections were now turned into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Channell; his thoughts were fixt in heaven, though his body was on earth, and therefore ‚Ä† <note place="margin">Aeternis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hianti in fasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio sunt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, <hi>i. e.

Oh then let vs prepare our selues to meet our God; let vs come before him with feare, and tremble at his iudgements. <hi>Feare not him</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>who when he hath killed the body, can doe no more, but feare him, who can cast both soule and body to hell; I say him feare.</hi> Oh how many of the Saints of God trembled<note place="margin">Quoties diem illum cogito toto corpore contremisco.

Let the examples of these Saints of God stirre vp in our hearts the like affections. Let it be the pitch of our desires, and the highest straine of all our endeauours, to attaine those heauƒìly mansions which our Saviour hath prouided for vs; and to avoid those endlesse, easelesse flames which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Diuell and his Angels. Who would gaine the purchase of a short and transient pleasure,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:176708:39"/> at so high a rate, as the heavy price of eternall fire? Besides how shall our tender bodies, which so shrinke at the prick of a pin, or flame of a candle endure those lasting pressures?</p>
                  <p>Who can dwell (saith the Prophet) with eternall fire, who can abide with euerlasting burnings?

Let vs first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our selues; for where mans conuersion begins, there Gods displeasure maketh his period. Excellent is that aduise of S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> weigh (saith he) and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the errors of thy life while thy time serues; Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at that strict judgement to come while thou hast<note place="margin">Culpam tuam (dum vacat) pƒìsa, &amp; distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri iudicii (dum vales) exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resce, ne tunc amaram sen tentiam audi as, eum nullis fletibus eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</note> health, least thou heare that bitter sentence (<hi>Goe yee cursed</hi>) goe forth against thee when it is too late. Did man knowe what time he should leaue the world, hee might proportion his time, some to pleasure, &amp; some to repentance. But hee that hath promised pardon to the penitent, hath not assured the sinner of an houres life. Since therefore we can neither preuent, nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see death, let vs alwaies expect it, and prouide for it. Let vs dye to our sinnes here, that wee may liue to Christ hereafter, and let vs suffer with Christ in this world, that we may reioyce and raigne with him in the world to come. <hi>Recusat esse in corpore, qui non vult odium sustinere cum capite.</hi> When we depart this life, we goe to an eternity, to an eternity I say, which shall neuer end, to an eternity <hi>quae facit omne bonum infinit√® melius, et omne malum, infinit√® molestius,</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euery good action infinitely better, and euery e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

Oh the vnhappinesse and everlasting woe of those men, who preferre the small and trifling things of this life, before the eternall weight of glory hereafter: who to enioy the short comfort of a miserable life here, are content to loose the presence of <hi>God and society of Angells hereafter.</hi>
